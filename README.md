# musicology-data-practices
This repository explores how research data are defined, produced, and managed in the field of musicology.

The project examines published studies across subfields such as digital musicology, ethnomusicology, historical musicology, and performance studies. The goal is to trace the data culture of musicology: what counts as data, where it lives, how it’s structured, and whether it’s made accessible for future research.

This repository includes:
1. A structured CSV dataset of coded articles 
2. A data dictionary

A work in progress!
