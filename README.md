# musicology-data-practices
This repository explores how data are defined, produced, and managed in the field of musicology, with a focus on the research lifecycle—from data creation and documentation to storage, access, and reuse.

The project examines published studies across subfields such as digital musicology, ethnomusicology, historical musicology, and performance studies, identifying how different kinds of musical data (scores, audio recordings, metadata, computational features, field notes, and annotations) are described and preserved.

The goal is to trace the data culture of musicology—what counts as data, where it lives, how it’s structured, and whether it’s made accessible for future research.

This repository includes:
1. A structured CSV dataset of coded articles (100 total)
   (Data Dictionary forethcoming)

2. Project notes
